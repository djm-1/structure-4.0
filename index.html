                The Joker is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was
                created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson, and first appeared in the debut issue of the comic
                book Batman on April 25, 1940. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed
                responsibility for the Joker's design while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the
                Joker
                was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention,
                allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman.

                    <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#010008; padding: 3em;">In early 1939, the
                        success of Superman in Action Comics prompted editors at
                        National Comics Publications (the future DC Comics) to request more superheroes for its titles.
                        In response, Bob Kane created "the Bat-Man". Collaborator Bill Finger recalled that "Kane had
                        an idea for a character called 'Batman,' and he'd like me to see the drawings. I went over to
                        Kane's, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of ...reddish
                        tights, I believe, with boots ...no gloves, no gauntlets ...with a small domino mask, swinging
                        on a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it
                        was a big sign ...BATMAN". The bat-wing-like cape was suggested by Bob Kane, inspired as a
                        child by Leonardo da Vinci's sketch of an ornithopter flying device.
                        <br>
                        Finger suggested giving the character a cowl instead of a simple domino mask, a cape instead of
                        wings, and gloves; he also recommended removing the red sections from the original
                        costume.Finger said he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret
                        identity: "Bruce Wayne's first name came from Robert the Bruce, the Scottish patriot. Wayne,
                        being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism. I
                        tried Adams, Hancock ...then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne."[13] He later said his suggestions
                        were influenced by Lee Falk's popular The Phantom, a syndicated newspaper comic-strip character
                        with which Kane was also familiar.

                        Batman had predecessors in the
                        Scarlet Pimpernel (created by Baroness Emmuska Orczy, 1903) and Zorro (created by Johnston
                        McCulley, 1919). Like them, Batman performed his heroic deeds in secret, averted suspicion by
                        playing aloof in public, and marked his work with a signature symbol. Kane noted the influence
                        of the films The Mark of Zorro (1920) and The Bat Whispers (1930) in the creation of the
                        character's iconography. Finger, drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like Doc Savage, The
                        Shadow, Dick Tracy, and Sherlock Holmes, made the character a master sleuth.

                    <p style="border:3px; border-style:dashed; border-color:#010008; padding: 3em;">In a report filed by
                        the GCPD, there were three theories that were presented
                        for the Joker's origin and identity. The first was that the Joker was institutionalized as a
                        patient at Arkham Asylum who got released when his scars were almost healed or escaped during
                        Ra's Al Ghul's and Scarecrow's reign of fear with all the other patients at the time in an even
                        worse condition (perhaps due to Scarecrow's terrible methods), which explained why most of
                        Joker's Henchmen were identified as some of the Arkham escapees. However, that theory was
                        debunked on the basis that Joker's identity had no basis within any records. The second theory
                        was that the Joker worked as a disgruntled employee or attraction for the Haley Brothers Circus,
                        which was documented to have connections with the mob and explained the clown makeup that Joker
                        always wore for his persona. The third theory that was presented was that the Joker served as a
                        soldier or Army Private until he was sent home because he suffered from acute PTSD, which
                        explained his cool demeanor and familiarity with weapons, as well as his devastating
                        effectiveness in various forms of combat. The third theory is further supported by his anecdote
                        to Harvey Dent about how if a mayor is killed by him it causes an uproar yet barely anyone cares
                        should he arrange for a truck containing soldiers to be blown up.</p>
