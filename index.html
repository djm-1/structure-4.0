          The Joker was a psychopathic anarchist mastermind who, portrayed himself as an agent of chaos, rose to power in the criminal underworld by thrusting Gotham City into turmoil and drew Batman ever closer to crossing the fine line between heroism and vigilantism. Described as a "psychopathic, mass murdering, diabolical clown with zero empathy," Joker was potent in both mental combat and strategic planning, and his physique was defined by his smeared clown makeup and gruesome Glasgow Smile that added sick comedy to all his crimes and misdeeds.

          <p class="card-text">The Joker's own testimony, while normally quite true when it came to carrying out threats, seemed at times contradictory, and he was known to give conflicting accounts at times when he described past events in his life, more specifically how he got the scars of his characteristic Glasgow Smile. One of Joker's anecdotes told of his supposed extremely abusive and alcoholic father, which stated that after he attacked his mother with a knife, the blade was next turned on the young man and created his mutilated smile. The fact that the Joker later referenced his father and his hatred of him to a party guest when he crashed Harvey Dent's party implied there was an element of truth to that account. Another story that Joker told was when his gambling wife told him not to worry so much and that he should smile more. That advice went overhead when she allowed her face to be carved by enforcers of Loan Sharks, and the couple discovered that they didn't have enough money to pay for the surgery. In a desperate effort to assure his wife that he didn't care about the damage to her appearance, Joker took a razor to his cheeks and made his Glasgow Smile match hers, but the disturbing image instead caused his wife to leave him, which damaged his psyche. It wasn't revealed to what degree those stories held the truth if any. It was possible that the Joker himself was unaware of his true origins. Some psychological profiles of The Joker, indicated that he was insane to such an extent that he literally reinvented both his own psyche and history on a daily basis. It was therefore possible that, while neither story was true, that Joker genuinely believed them both as he told them. Joker presumably was going to tell Batman the third version of his scar story when he was about to kill him, but he ultimately did not get the chance to do so due to Batman literally shutting him up by using launching his wrist blades at him, who then claimed that Batman knew how Joker got those scars other than the Glasgow scars on his mouth.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text">In a report filed by the GCPD, there were three theories that were presented for the Joker's origin and identity. The first was that the Joker was institutionalized as a patient at Arkham Asylum who got released when his scars were almost healed or escaped during Ra's Al Ghul's and Scarecrow's reign of fear with all the other patients at the time in an even worse condition (perhaps due to Scarecrow's terrible methods), which explained why most of Joker's Henchmen were identified as some of the Arkham escapees. However, that theory was debunked on the basis that Joker's identity had no basis within any records. The second theory was that the Joker worked as a disgruntled employee or attraction for the Haley Brothers Circus, which was documented to have connections with the mob and explained the clown makeup that Joker always wore for his persona. The third theory that was presented was that the Joker served as a soldier or Army Private until he was sent home because he suffered from acute PTSD, which explained his cool demeanor and familiarity with weapons, as well as his devastating effectiveness in various forms of combat. The third theory is further supported by his anecdote to Harvey Dent about how if a mayor is killed by him it causes an uproar yet barely anyone cares should he arrange for a truck containing soldiers to be blown up.</p>
