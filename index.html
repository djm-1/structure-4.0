            The Joker was a psychopathic anarchist mastermind who, portrayed himself as an agent of chaos, rose to power
            in the criminal underworld by thrusting Gotham City into turmoil and drew Batman ever closer to crossing the
            fine line between heroism and vigilantism. Described as a "psychopathic, mass murdering, diabolical clown
            with zero empathy," Joker was potent in both mental combat and strategic planning, and his physique was
            defined by his smeared clown makeup and gruesome Glasgow Smile that added sick comedy to all his crimes and
            misdeeds.

                    <h5 class="card-title">Insight 1</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The Joker's own testimony, while normally quite true when it came to carrying
                        out threats, seemed at times contradictory, and he was known to give conflicting accounts at
                        times when he described past events in his life, more specifically how he got the scars of his
                        characteristic Glasgow Smile. One of Joker's anecdotes told of his supposed extremely abusive
                        and alcoholic father, which stated that after he attacked his mother with a knife, the blade was
                        next turned on the young man and created his mutilated smile. The fact that the Joker later
                        referenced his father and his hatred of him to a party guest when he crashed Harvey Dent's party
                        implied there was an element of truth to that account. Another story that Joker told was when
                        his gambling wife told him not to worry so much and that he should smile more. That advice went
                        overhead when she allowed her face to be carved by enforcers of Loan Sharks, and the couple
                        discovered that they didn't have enough money to pay for the surgery. In a desperate effort to
                        assure his wife that he didn't care about the damage to her appearance, Joker took a razor to
                        his cheeks and made his Glasgow Smile match hers, but the disturbing image instead caused his
                        wife to leave him, which damaged his psyche. It wasn't revealed to what degree those stories
                        held the truth if any. It was possible that the Joker himself was unaware of his true origins.
                        Some psychological profiles of The Joker, indicated that he was insane to such an extent that he
                        literally reinvented both his own psyche and history on a daily basis. It was therefore possible
                        that, while neither story was true, that Joker genuinely believed them both as he told them.
                        Joker presumably was going to tell Batman the third version of his scar story when he was about
                        to kill him, but he ultimately did not get the chance to do so due to Batman literally shutting
                        him up by using launching his wrist blades at him, who then claimed that Batman knew how Joker
                        got those scars other than the Glasgow scars on his mouth.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Insight 2</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">In a report filed by the GCPD, there were three theories that were presented
                        for the Joker's origin and identity. The first was that the Joker was institutionalized as a
                        patient at Arkham Asylum who got released when his scars were almost healed or escaped during
                        Ra's Al Ghul's and Scarecrow's reign of fear with all the other patients at the time in an even
                        worse condition (perhaps due to Scarecrow's terrible methods), which explained why most of
                        Joker's Henchmen were identified as some of the Arkham escapees. However, that theory was
                        debunked on the basis that Joker's identity had no basis within any records. The second theory
                        was that the Joker worked as a disgruntled employee or attraction for the Haley Brothers Circus,
                        which was documented to have connections with the mob and explained the clown makeup that Joker
                        always wore for his persona. The third theory that was presented was that the Joker served as a
                        soldier or Army Private until he was sent home because he suffered from acute PTSD, which
                        explained his cool demeanor and familiarity with weapons, as well as his devastating
                        effectiveness in various forms of combat. The third theory is further supported by his anecdote
                        to Harvey Dent about how if a mayor is killed by him it causes an uproar yet barely anyone cares
                        should he arrange for a truck containing soldiers to be blown up.</p>
